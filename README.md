# task no 1 : titanic survival prediction
# problem statement
#Titanic Survival Prediction is a classic data science project based on the Titanic dataset , 
which contains information about passenger who were on board the Titanic,icluding whether they survived or not. 
The goal is to build predictive model that can predict whether 
a passenger would have syrvived the Titanic disaster based on features like agr,gender,ticket class and many more
# Data Science Techniques
   - This project typically involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and machine learning.
   - You'll use algorithms like logistic regression, decision trees, or random forests for prediction.
